                    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> For people living below poverty line, an illness not only represents a permanent threat to their
                        income earning capacity, in many cases it could result in the family falling into a debt trap.
                        When the need to get the treatment arises for poor families they often ignore it because of lack
                        of resources, fearing wage loss, or wait till the last moment when it’s too late. Even if they
                        do decide to get the desired health care it consumes their savings, forces them to sell their
                        assets and property or cut other important spending like children’s education. Alternatively
                        they have to take on huge debts. Ignoring the treatment may lead to unnecessary suffering and
                        death while selling property or taking debts may end a family’s hope of ever escaping poverty.

                        These tragic outcomes can be avoided through a health insurance which shares the risk of a major
                        health shock across many households by pooling them together. A well designed and implemented
                        health insurance may both increase access to healthcare and may even improve its quality over
                        time.

                        In the past Government have tried to provide a health insurance cover to selected beneficiaries
                        either at the State level or National level. However, most of these schemes were not able to
                        achieve their intended objectives. Often there were issues with either the design and/ or
                        implementation of these schemes.

                        Keeping this background in mind, Government of India decided to design a health insurance scheme
                        which not only avoids the pitfalls of the earlier schemes but goes a step beyond and provides a
                        world class model. A critical review of the existing and earlier health insurance schemes was
                        done with the objective of learning from their good practices as well as seeks lessons from the
                        mistakes. After taking all this into account and also reviewing other successful models of
                        health insurance in the world in similar settings, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna was designed.

                        RSBY has been launched by Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India to provide
                        health insurance coverage for Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. The objective of RSBY is to
                        provide protection to BPL households from financial liabilities arising out of health shocks
                        that involve hospitalization. Beneficiaries under RSBY are entitled to hospitalization coverage
                        up to Rs. 30,000/- for most of the diseases that require hospitalization. Government has even
                        fixed the package rates for the hospitals for a large number of interventions. Pre-existing
                        conditions are covered from day one and there is no age limit. Coverage extends to five members
                        of the family which includes the head of household, spouse and up to three dependents.
                        Beneficiaries need to pay only Rs. 30/- as registration fee while Central and State Government
                        pays the premium to the insurer selected by the State Government on the basis of a competitive
                        bidding.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is an Indian law that aims
                        to guarantee the 'right to work' and ensure livelihood security in rural areas by providing at
                        least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult
                        members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

                        In accordance with the Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that defines the

                        India and hence is termed as a "People’s Act".

                        Further conforming to the Article 21 of the Constitution of India that guarantees the right to
                        life with dignity to every citizen of India, this act imparts dignity to the rural people
                        through an assurance of livelihood security. People of rural areas are entitled to employment
                        under the act, failing which the government is liable to pay an unemployment allowance within
                        the stipulated time of 15 days. For poverty alleviation and rural development, the mission of
                        MGNREGA is to provide job on demand in order to ensure livelihood security and at the same time
                        create durable assets to augment basic resources available to the poor.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> Public Distribution System (PDS) is an Indian food security system. Established by the Government
                        of India under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution and managed jointly
                        with state governments in India, it distributes subsidized food and non-food items to India's
                        poor. Major commodities distributed include staple food grains, such as wheat, rice, sugar, and
                        kerosene, through a network of Public distribution shops, also known as Ration shops established
                        in several states across the country. Food Corporation of India, a Government-owned corporation,
                        procures and maintains the Public Distribution System.

                        In terms of both coverage and public expenditure, it is considered to be the most important food
                        security network. However, the food grains supplied by the ration shops are not enough to meet
                        the consumption needs of the poor or are of inferior quality. The average level of consumption
                        of PDS grains in India is only 1 kg per person / month. The PDS has been criticised for its
                        urban bias and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the population effectively. The
                        targeted PDS is costly and gives rise to much corruption in the process of extricating the poor
                        from those who are less needy. Today, India has the largest stock of grain in the world besides
                        China, the government spends Rs. 750 billion ($13.6 billion) per year, almost 1 percent of GDP,
                        yet 21% remain undernourished. Distribution of food grains to poor people throughout the country
                        is managed by state governments. As of date there are about 5 million Fair Price Shops (FPS)
                        across India.

                        identifiable under the Indian Income Tax Act 1961. It is issued by the Indian Income Tax
                        Department under the supervision of the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) and it also serves
                        as an important ID proof.

                        This number is almost mandatory for financial transactions such as opening a bank account,
                        receiving taxable salary or professional fees, sale or purchase of assets above specified limits
                        etc. The primary purpose of PAN is to bring a universal identification key factor for all
                        financial transactions and indirectly prevent tax evasion by keeping a track of monetary
                        transactions of high net worth individuals. The PAN is unique, national, and permanent. It is

                    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency
                        electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and
                        tracking tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Some tags
                        are powered by and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields (electromagnetic
                        induction). Others use a local power source such as a battery, or else have no battery but
                        collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive transponder to emit
                        microwaves or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies). Battery
                        powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters. Unlike a bar code, the tag does not necessarily
                        need to be within line of sight of the reader, and may be embedded in the tracked object.

                        RFID tags are used in many industries. An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production
                        can be used to track its progress through the assembly line. Pharmaceuticals can be tracked
                        through warehouses. Livestock and pets may have tags injected, allowing positive identification
                        of the animal. On off-shore oil and gas platforms, RFID tags are worn by personnel as a safety
                        measure, allowing them to be located 24 hours a day and to be quickly found in emergencies.

                        Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing, possessions, or even implanted within people, the
                        possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy
                        concerns.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> Digital banking circumscribes composite services delivered over the Web, which aim at serving
                        both banks and consumers as a means of providing a convenient, faster and better experience than
                        traditional banking. The shift from traditional and digital banking is gradual and should be
                        rather described in degrees of service digitization than through a categorization into yes and
                        no. It involves high levels of process automation and web-based services and may include APIs
                        enabling cross-institutional service composition to deliver banking products and provide
                        transactions. It provides the ability for users to access financial data through desktops,
                        mobile devices and ATM machines.</p>
